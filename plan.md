## Version 2.0.0 to do:

1. Replace console logs with errors
   -adjust tests accordingly
2. Pull the little functions out into separate components (helpers)
3. Add toUppercase so that the thing works regardless of casing of arguments (e.g. "remove" vs "Remove" vs "REMOVE")
4. Find a way to clip the domain name (API/package?)
5. Include Chris Miller in acknowledgements in Readme.
