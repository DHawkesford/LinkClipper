What's left to do:

1. Finish the tests
2. Change the console.log testing to a less strict matcher (including "Error")
3. Think about the start remove functionality- user would expect it to remove the whole start of url, regardless of whether it contains www., https: or both www. and https://
4. Find solution for second and third level domain names.
5. Update the Readme
6. Publish final version (copy readme to description ?)
7. Do some marketing on slack
